<h3>Evening events</h3>

<p>There will be a drinks reception on Monday afternoon followed by a BBQ at the Vale. This is a beautifully landscaped area with a central hub and a bar and is where the majority of participants will be staying.  All sponsors of the Conference are welcome to attend. Further details will be provided on the day.</p>

<p>The Conference Dinner on Tuesday night will be a ‘street  food’ themed event held at Alfie Birds ‘Eats and Beats’ in the Custard Factory in Digbeth. This former Birds Custard Factory is home to some of Birmingham’s coolest shops and people and our street food vendors include Meatshack, one of Birmingham’s best burger purveyors; Baked in Brick who makes and serves pizzas from the back of a converted Mini, and Lap Fai-Lee, one of our very own <a href="http://www.backyardbrummies.com">Backyard Brummies</a> who have won various BBQ categories at the annual Grillstock BBQ competition (other members of this team include Nick Loman, the conference organiser).  The event will be indoor and outdoor with a DJ, and we are expecting this to prove to be a fantastic networking opportunity for our sponsors!</p>
