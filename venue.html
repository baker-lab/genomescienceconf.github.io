<h2>The University of Birmingham</h2>

<p> The University of Birmingham is situated on a beautiful campus two miles from the city centre, in the UK’s second largest city.  The conference will be held in the University’s well known Grade II listed Aston Webb building and the recently completed Bramall Music Building, which are located next to the tallest freestanding clock tower in the world, affectionately known as Old Joe (named after the first Chancellor of the University, Joseph Chamberlain).
On campus the University has a number of unique cultural assets including the Lapworth Museum of Geology, Winterbourne House and Gardens, the Barber Institute of Fine Art and a superb sculpture trail across campus featuring works by Paolozzi and Hepworth amongst others.</p>

The University is located just over two miles from the city centre and is just off Bristol Road (A38).  This major artery is a continuation of the M6 exit via the Aston Expressway and makes finding the University campus fairly straightforward.  The University also has its own train station (called ‘University’) which is two stops from the main train station at New Street.

<h3>Travelling to the UK</h3>

<p>If you travel to the UK you will probably arrive by flying to London Heathrow, London Gatwick or Birmingham International airport. </p>

<h4>Finding your way to the University Campus</h4

<p>Please check the following information to help you plan your journey to our campus.</p>

<h4>Arriving at Birmingham International Airport</h4>

<p>Option 1: Taxi - costs approximately £25, takes approximately 30 minutes</p>
<p>igns in the airport will show you where you can get a taxi, and the taxi can take you directly to your University accommodation at Lucas House or to the University Main Entrance (East Gate, Edgbaston Park Road) where you can make your way to the Great Hall for registration. The attached campus map shows the locations of this entrance and the Great Hall.</p>

<p>Option 2: Train – costs approximately £15, takes approximately 60 minutes</p>

<p>There is a free monorail service between the airport and Birmingham International train station. At Birmingham International train station you will need to take a train to Birmingham New Street. You can then take another train direct to University station (two stops) or you may find it more convenient with heavy luggage to take a taxi from New Street Station directly to your University destination (about £10). There are regular trains between 06:00 and 23:00 (search the train timetable). There is more information about train travel later in this pack.</p>

<p>If you are travelling by train from any other location in the UK, you will find that most cross-country services to Birmingham arrive at New Street Station. Up to six trains an hour depart for the University on the cross-city line (ten minutes to University station, final destination Longbridge or Redditch). The centre of the main campus is a five-minute walk from University Station – turn left out of the station, walking straight ahead past the large ‘Faraday’ statue.  Keep walking straight ahead past ‘University Centre’ on your left, under an arch and you will come into the green heart of campus.  To the right are the red brick buildings of the Law School, and behind that, the clock tower, ‘Old Joe’.  Head for Old Joe and you will see the semicircular ‘Aston Webb’ buildings ahead of you. The main doors lead into the Great Hall. </p>
