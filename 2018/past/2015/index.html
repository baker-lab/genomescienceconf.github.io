<h2>Genome Science 2015 will be held at the University of Birmingham</h2>
<h3>7th - 9th September 2015</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Genome Science started life in 2011 as the UK Next Generation Sequencing Meeting, hosted by the DeepSeq facility at the University of Nottingham.  In 2014, the conference underwent a rebranding and became Genome Science: Biology, Applications and Technology. The 2014 conference was hosted by Chris Ponting at the University of Oxford and attracted 300 attendees. This year's conference will be the biggest yet, with capacity for 350 at the University of Birmingham.</p>
